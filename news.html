  <h2><a href="/2012/05/15/Dates-and-Updates">15 May 2012: Dates and Updates</a></h2>
<p>Hi Everyone</p>

<p>Just thought would give you an update on how things are going.</p>

<p>Well the lift is finally working again and it is going to cost - but what can you do.  The contract we had in place was inadequate for the sake of a few pounds more !!.<br/>
I have agreed to a new comprehensive package but this does not kick in until August.  Fingers crossed all goes well till then.</p>

<p>To date we have had to send out 9 final letters for non payment.  Of those one has come forward and agreed to pay. We will look at seeking legal advise next month if no contact- or payments received.</p>

<p>Key Dates</p>

<p>Clean up day:</p>

<p>This is set for 23 June starting at 11.00am or earlier if you are down.  Bring with you a Mop, bucket, brush and some old rags.  For this we want to really clean the blocks down.  A good spring (summer) clean to start the year.  I would also like to get the railings on both sets of stairs - particular the bottom floors repainted and rust removed.  If any of you attending have a drill bring it with you we will buy some little sanding fittings to clean down railings and then give a protective coating of paint.  Again hopefully do a little cleaning of outside particularly the side/front of blue block- Block B.<br/>
Will email you all again about 1 or 2 weeks prior to this date to confirm if you are coming.<br/>
Also after our hard work and cleaning - Yes what you have been waiting for !!!  ha ha
The bar-be-que
I hope for us all to get-together and meet up have a chat and have a bar-be-que.  So when buying food etc will need to know if you can attend.</p>

<p>Insurance:</p>

<p>We have renewed our insurance for the year and a Big Thank you to those  who worked very hard on the quotes in Particular to Derek O'Connor (who never wants to hear my name again ha ha )</p>

<p>Electric:</p>

<p>Hopefully with the new light switches the bills will start to decrease.  We inherited a big bill and hopefully now get this in check.</p>

<p>Cleaning:</p>

<p>Can I ask everyone when your down if you could sweep the Half of the hall and one flight of stairs next to your apartment to help out with keeping the place clean.  Do date I have not spent any money on cleaning and have myself cleaned Block A both sweeping and washing out.  At the weekend I swept out Block B as it was just awful.  If we all clean outside our apartments and half way along the corridor if on stairs one flight.  It would be a great help.  Otherwise we will have to pay for cleaner a few times a year.</p>

<p>Maintenance:</p>

<p>some parts of the building inside and out are literally falling apart- at present the side gate is off and is to be repaired working on it now but again it may end up costing if we can't get it fixed ourselves.</p>

<p>A big thank you to David McCullagh and Martin McGrinder who both work tirelessly to try to get the block in order.</p>

<p>Finally August:</p>

<p>The smoke and Fire Alarms are getting checked - date to be agreed - I need access to each apartment hallway so start thinking about coming up or getting your key to me in order to gain access to have checked.  This is essential to keep our fire cert up to date and abide by insurance.  Failure to have all checked could leave our block insurance void.   Will come back with date as soon as Alarm company agree date.</p>

<p>So Good luck for now and I will be in touch</p>

<p>Eileen</p>

  <h2><a href="/2012/04/17/Lifts-%28or-lack-thereof%29">17 April 2012: Lifts (or lack thereof)</a></h2>
<p>Hi everyone</p>

<p>The lift has been playing up for a number of weeks- it did not work at all over Easter and is down again.  I know this created some inconvenience for people and whilst some were understanding others were vocal about it not working.  The problem is that the heater box for the oil is not working and until replaced the lift will not function. The hydraulic fuel needs to be warm to thin down and complete its job.</p>

<p>I have now received the quote for replacing this heater box total with VAT is 817 euro - a bit of a shock !!!!
If we do not fix the lift within 14 day we will render our current contract void and OTIS will no longer complete any services or maintenance - no other lift company will take us on with a broken lift.</p>

<p>I had just negotiated a good price for a comprehensive cover package covering all services and parts but it does not kick in until August when our current contract is up-  so hopefully this is the last time we will be in this position,</p>

<p>I think on this occasion our back is against the wall and we will have no choice to pay the bill.  I did manage to get them to drop a bill previously for almost 500 euro that was incurred by Dermott so I think payback time ha ha</p>

<p>We were on a roll with work and the communal windows are planned to get repaired this week.</p>

<p>I think we will have to pay to keep ourselves right, hopefully you will support my decision to pay comments asap as need to get back to otis the lift company as the part will have to be ordered.</p>

  <h2><a href="/2012/03/25/Electric+Switches">25 March 2012: Electric Switches</a></h2>
<p>Hi Everyone
Just another quick update ( okay not so quick)</p>

<p>You will be delighted to learn that the push buttons for the electric switches were fitted on Saturday.  Having priced around as many people as I could.  I believe I got a good price from the electrical wholesalers who then agreed to send their fitter at cost price.  So I think we got a good deal on that.  It turns out between both buildings there was 54 switches!!  Thats a lot more than we thought - but they are working well.  We paid an eletric bill £2,300 via Dermot and I just paid £558.00 euro so need to bring that cost down asap. So this measure will no doubt pay for itself very quickly. Beacause the lights are contiually being left on they are also burning themselves out.</p>

<p>The fires extingushers were removed during the week  (replacements have been put in place temporary measure) next week they will be back in place and the hallways will have new signage and the extingushers will be back serviced and fully compliant.</p>

<p>I have had one fella out last week pricing the fixing of the communial windows and another on Saturday so hopefully that will be sorted soon.  To date only 12 people have paid (this includes us also) so panicing a bit but hopefully the rest will pay soon. As everything I have planned is based on 26-28 people paying.
I am so watching the money and getting the best prices for work, asking for favours and giving a lot of helpless smiles ha ha (me helpless - ha ha)</p>

<p>After the windows are fixed providing we can pay the next bills ie insurance and lift - the painting of outside of buildings is the next big thing to be done.  So fingers crossed all pay up soon and we will be on track.  Ideally when all major work is completed it would be nice to have the inside of buildings painted - but for now thats just wishful but who knows.</p>

<p>If we manage to get all major maintenance works done this year - bearing in mind it is just bringing up to a reasonable standard we can be off to a flying start next year, this could be a small reduction in fees or upgrades but that is for next year.</p>

<p>Let me know any comments or concerns you might have with regrards work etc - as I have just rattled off here and done what I do at work and got the quotes and went with best price.  So hopefully I have not ruffled any feathers :) so sorry!  but thats me I just get it done ha ha</p>

<p>It is in everyones best interest to get building up to a resonable standard, not only is it the law, but it is safer and better still adding value to the price of your apartment.</p>

<p>Chat to you all later - and Hopefully our clean up day will also be a great get-together day and a bit of fun. This is going to be 23 June and I am going to do a schedule of work to be done on that day so suggestions very welcome railings on stairs a major one.</p>

<p>Yes this is me finshed now - Have a nice weekend the sun is out enjoy :)</p>

  <h2><a href="/2012/02/15/First-Order-of-Business">15 February 2012: First Order of Business</a></h2>
<p>Hi Guys</p>

<p>As you know Martin and Gerry met with the bank to open an account.  We have had no feed back as yet so presume all is well in that respects. (Will let you know if any problems Gerry)</p>

<p>The bin has been emptied - thanks David</p>

<p>Update - Martin and David have been working their guts out all week - lifting equipment (Cherry picker) came in on Monday Morning and all spouting's were cleaned they were in a sorry state and for some guttering was just hanging off and about to fall.  Some of the guttering was replaced as missing, others were unblocked and put back into position.  A few replacements boards also put on,  once up that height a major problem spotted - some ridge tiles were missing and had to be replaced (it would seem they have been missing for quite a while.)   (Paul you seen the heights and antics of those guys- ha ha not for the faint hearted)</p>

<p>Over the past weeks it is evident that the buildings were starting to fall into a state of disrepair so  action had to be taken.</p>

<p>The glass that was broken in both blocks has been replaced.</p>

<p>The Electric that kept beeping in block A has had a new back up battery and quick check.  The lights in both buildings have been checked and quite a few bulbs and condensers been fitted to put back in working order.</p>

<p>The electric account is finally back in the company name as from today - but on the down side we are also inheriting a bill for electric!!</p>

<p>Post boxes have been ordered today a total of 33 -  32 for the apartments and one for the management Company.  The purpose of the management company having its own box is to differentiate from personal mail boxes and for the company to have its own identity.  As soon as the mail boxes arrive they will be secured to the hallway walls and each owner will be issued a box.</p>

<p>Once boxes are up I will visit the post office and talk to the post delivery person (being politically correct :) ) and get the delivery person to put mail into the relevant boxes.</p>

<p>Martin and David are still working away at the apartments' today doing repairs and trying to make some headway with unfinshed work.  It is hope to get the lifting equipement back again in few week to do some more work on the buildings.</p>

<p>Over the next few days I will forward to you all the summary of accounts from last year on a spreadsheet etc  I am having a little trouble matching some figures up so want to be sure before I put to paper.</p>

<p>Bill to be paid at the minute (inhertited bills)
Electric - amount is to be forwared by Air Tricity they would not commit to amount.
The Solicitors fees for recouping of back fees - We did not receive this it was paid to Dermot and Laura who in turn took for payment of their fees.
Otis (lift)
Accoutants fees (still to be inoviced for this years accounts)</p>

<p>We can organise another meeting around St Paddy's day if everyone was coing down to stay for the bank holiday.</p>

<p>Feel free in the mean-time to email me with any questions or queries as this is more sesnsible than calling a meeting to discuss what is happening at the minute.</p>

<p>Eileen</p>
