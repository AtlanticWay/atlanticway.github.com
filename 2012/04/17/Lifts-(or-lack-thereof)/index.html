				<p>Hi everyone</p>

<p>The lift has been playing up for a number of weeks- it did not work at all over Easter and is down again.  I know this created some inconvenience for people and whilst some were understanding others were vocal about it not working.  The problem is that the heater box for the oil is not working and until replaced the lift will not function. The hydraulic fuel needs to be warm to thin down and complete its job.</p>

<p>I have now received the quote for replacing this heater box total with VAT is 817 euro - a bit of a shock !!!!
If we do not fix the lift within 14 day we will render our current contract void and OTIS will no longer complete any services or maintenance - no other lift company will take us on with a broken lift.</p>

<p>I had just negotiated a good price for a comprehensive cover package covering all services and parts but it does not kick in until August when our current contract is up-  so hopefully this is the last time we will be in this position,</p>

<p>I think on this occasion our back is against the wall and we will have no choice to pay the bill.  I did manage to get them to drop a bill previously for almost 500 euro that was incurred by Dermott so I think payback time ha ha</p>

<p>We were on a roll with work and the communal windows are planned to get repaired this week.</p>

<p>I think we will have to pay to keep ourselves right, hopefully you will support my decision to pay comments asap as need to get back to otis the lift company as the part will have to be ordered.</p>

<p>Eileen</p>
