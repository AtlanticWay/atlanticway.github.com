  <h2><a href="/2012/05/15/Dates-and-Updates">15 May 2012: Dates and Updates</a></h2>
Hi Everyone</br></br>Just thought would give you an update on how things are going.</br></br>Well the lift is finally working again and it is going to cost - but what can you do.  The contract we had in place was inadequate for the sake of a few pounds more !!.</br></br>I have agreed to a new comprehensive package but this does not kick in until August.  Fingers crossed all goes well till then.</br></br>To date we have had to send out 9 final letters for non payment.  Of those one has come forward and agreed to pay. We will look at seeking legal advise next month if no contact- or payments received.

  <h2><a href="/2012/04/17/Lifts-%28or-lack-thereof%29">17 April 2012: Lifts (or lack thereof)</a></h2>
Hi everyone</br></br>The lift has been playing up for a number of weeks- it did not work at all over Easter and is down again.  I know this created some inconvenience for people and whilst some were understanding others were vocal about it not working.  The problem is that the heater box for the oil is not working and until replaced the lift will not function. The hydraulic fuel needs to be warm to thin down and complete its job.

  <h2><a href="/2012/03/25/Electric+Switches">25 March 2012: Electric Switches</a></h2>
Hi Everyone</br></br>Just another quick update ( okay not so quick)</br></br>You will be delighted to learn that the push buttons for the electric switches were fitted on Saturday.  Having priced around as many people as I could.  I believe I got a good price from the electrical wholesalers who then agreed to send their fitter at cost price.  So I think we got a good deal on that.  It turns out between both buildings there was 54 switches!!  Thats a lot more than we thought - but they are working well.  We paid an eletric bill ú2,300 via Dermot and I just paid ú558.00 euro so need to bring that cost down asap. So this measure will no doubt pay for itself very quickly. Beacause the lights are contiually being left on they are also burning themselves out.

Hi Everyone,</br></br>Just to give you an update.  The mail boxes are installed and up and running from tomorrow morning.  Each apartment has been allocated a box and can gain access with a key.  Keys to individual mail boxes can be got from us.  I will be up St Patricks weekend if you want me to hand it to you.  Also if you want me to put it under your door send me a mail - not possible for all doors as their is no gap.  Other than that contact me to make arrangments to collect key.
