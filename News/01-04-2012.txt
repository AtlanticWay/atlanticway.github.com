Hi Everyone
 
If we manage to get a few other people to pay their fees we will be on to the next stage of repairs.  The communal windows which I hope to have completed the week after Easter.  I have negotiated with the man repairing the windows to give a very competitive/reduced price to other apartment owners if they want their windows repaired at the same time.  If you have any windows that are not opening, or broken handles etc and want to avail of this offer can you email me back.  This is a chance to get windows repaired ( or in some cases opening) at a reduced price- Note however if you don't avail of this offer this time it may be a lot more expensive next time.
 
Fire Alarms
The fire alarms have been tested and are up to standard - but the sensors in each apartment need to be checked also.  Therefore Just to let you know now that we will need to gain access to your apartment in August to have this completed and ensure that they are fully working.  So  we will need to ensure that you will be down that week or if you cannot if you can make arrangements to leave your key with me to have this completed.  This is a compulsory check so if not completed it could have insurance implications.
 
Clean up day
Clean up day has been agreed for the 23 June - we also intend to have this as a get-together day and hopefully have a barbeque.  So if you can let me know if you intend to come as we will need to purchase food etc.  I can check with you all nearer the time but letting you know now to mark it in your diary.
 
Sea Sessions Bundoran is 28th June -1July if your interested in this event? If you don't like noise avoid the apartments that weekend at all costs ha ha.
 
I will keep you all updated on repairs - events etc and if you need to contact me feel free to email me
 
 
Eileen
