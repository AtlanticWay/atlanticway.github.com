Hi Everyone
 
Just to give you an update.  The mail boxes are installed and up and running from tomorrow morning.  Each apartment has been allocated a box and can gain access with a key.  Keys to individual mail boxes can be got from us.  I will be up St Patricks weekend if you want me to hand it to you.  Also if you want me to put it under your door send me a mail - not possible for all doors as their is no gap.  Other than that contact me to make arrangments to collect key.
 
Please not that mail will no longer being going to Bank House B&B  Start using the adress as below
 
Block A is the cream block or Front Block
Block B is the Blue Block  or the side block
 
Any questions - email me I will only too gladly try to help
 
Eileen
